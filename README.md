####  Documentation  
  <!-- * in your README, write documentation for you data structures
  * your documentation should includes code block useage examples
  * provide instructions for:
    * installing and using your data structure
    * accessing each method
    * running your tests -->

#### Feature Tasks  
* implement a Singly Linked List (SLL) data structor  
* implement `append(value)`, `prepend(value)`, `reverse()`, and `remove(offset)` methods to the SLL prototype
* in a comment within each function, note the it's Big-O runtime

## Bonus Points:
  * 2pts
  * implement `findNthNodeFromEnd(n)` as a method on the SLL prototype
    * takes `n` as an input/argument, representing the offset from the end to return
    * returns the nth node from the end (opposite of head) of the list
  * implement `findMiddleNode()` as a pure method on the SLL prototype
    * returns the middle node within the list
